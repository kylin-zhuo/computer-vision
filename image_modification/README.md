# Image Modification

This program implement the basic manipulation of computer vision.

- reload the original image
- save the current image
- convert the image to grayscale using openCV conversion function
- convert the image to grayscale using own implementation
- cycle through the color channels of the image showing a different channel every time
- convert the image to grayscale and smooth it using the openCV function
- convert the image to grayscale and smooth it using own filter
- downsample the image by a factor of 2 without smoothing
- downsample the image by a factor of 2 with smoothing
- convert the image to grayscale and perform convolution with an x derivative filter
- convert the image to grayscale and perform convolution with an y derivative filter
- show the magnitude of the gradient
- convert the image to grayscale and plot the gradient vector every N pixels
- convert the image to grayscale and rotate it using a specific angle
